# React-Firebase CRUD app

Yes I know the last the thing the world needs is another React CRUD app but guess what? I didn't build this for you.
I built this to get to grips with the React + Firebase combo as I thought it would be good for rapid prototyping of ideas and guess what? It is!


To start the server, cd into the project directory and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes but I'm not sure why you would want to make changes to this work of art
